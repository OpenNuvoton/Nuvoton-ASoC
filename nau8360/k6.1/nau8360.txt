The Nuvoton NAU83G60 Stereo Class-D Amplifier with DSP and I/V-sense driver.

This device supports I2C only.

Required properties:
  - compatible: "nuvoton,nau8360"

  - reg: the I2C address of the device.
      0x1A (GPIO2=0 && GPIO1=0)
      0x1B (GPIO2=0 && GPIO1=1)
      0x4A (GPIO2=1 && GPIO1=0)
      0x4B (GPIO2=1 && GPIO1=1)

Optional properties:
  - nuvoton,dsp-bypass: Forcely disable/bypass DSP path.

  - nuvoton,low-latency: Enable low latency mode.
      Please note the feature helps sensing performance but worses power comsuption.

  - nuvoton,anc-enable: Enable ANC feature.
      NAU83G60 provides configurable low latency ANC path to Advanced DSP through TDM-RX.
      To reduce latency, the ANC path only supports 48KHz sample rates.

  - nuvoton,aec-enable: Enable AEC feature.
      NAU83G60 provides Advanced DSP processed audio data as AEC reference through TDM-TX.
      The AEC path only supports 48KHz sample rates.

  - nuvoton,power-supply: number from 8 to 24 that specify the voltage of the extneral power source.
      The NAU83G60 needs two external power source to operate. The VBAT is designed to connect with the external
      power supply or battery cells which the voltage range is 8V ~ 24V as the analog domain power source.

  - nuvoton,tdm-channel-length: Assign TDM channel length. The length must be 16, 24, or 32.

  - nuvoton,dsp-fw-names: Assign firmware for left and right DSP core.

Example:

  nau8360@1a {
      compatible = "nuvoton,nau8360";
      reg = <0x1a>;
      nuvoton,aec-enable;
      nuvoton,power-supply = <12>;
      nuvoton,dsp-fw-names = "NAU83G60.kcs.bin.l" , "NAU83G60.kcs.bin.r";
  };
