The NAU83110 ALSA SoC audio driver.
The codec is a mono high efficiency filter-free Class-D audio amplifier,
which is capable of driving a 4Ω load with up to 20.8W output power at 12.6V supply.

This device supports I2C only.

Required properties:
  - compatible: "nuvoton,nau83110"

  - reg: the I2C address of the device.
      0x2A (addr1=0 && addr0=0)
      0x2B (addr1=0 && addr0=1)
      0x5A (addr1=1 && addr0=0)
      0x5B (addr1=1 && addr0=1)

Optional properties:
  - interrupts : Interrupt specifier for the chip's IRQ pin.
      IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH: The interrupt is level-triggered and The active voltage level is high.
      If this option is specified, the interrupt controller detects this high-level signal on the IRQ number and
      triggers the corresponding interrupt handler in the driver.

  - nuvoton,enable-gpios : GPIO specifier for the chip's Device Enable (EN) pin.
      If this option is not specified, then driver does not manage
      the pin state (e.g. chip is always on).
  - nuvoton,wq-delay-ms : Delay in milliseconds for the SCP diagnostic workqueue.
      Controls how often the diagnostic routine is executed after an SCP event.

Example:

  nau83110@5B {
      compatible = "nuvoton,nau83110";
      reg = <0x5B>;
      interrupts = <23 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
      nuvoton,enable-gpios = <&gpio 24 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
  };
